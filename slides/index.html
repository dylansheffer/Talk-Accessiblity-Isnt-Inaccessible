						I've made this talk because I noticed that when I talk about a11y to people, people generally shy away from it for a few reasons.

						1. It seems difficult
						2. It doesn't seem like it is worth the effort because not many people use assistive technology
						3. People are unaware or didn't think about it

						Hopefully I'll be able to disprove some misunderstandings.

							<blockquote>"The inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to websites, by people with disabilities. <br /><br />
							When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, <strong>all</strong> users have equal access to information and functionality."</blockquote>

						<h1>RealTalk</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							I generally like to keep my talks light, but before I continue we need to understand why this is such an important part of our job as developers.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="large-text ">It is critical we do this right</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Accessibility isn't like keeping up with the latest development tools where it's nice to know, but can be shrugged away.

							This is about ensuring that all people have the same access to information regardless of ability.

							It is our shared responsibility that we preserve this fundamental human right to information and expression.

							And if this sounds overly dramatic listen this quote.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div>
							<blockquote>
								"Yes. [The Internet is] an essential tool. And, literally, a lifeline for many disabled people... Many disabled people have to spend long hours alone. Voice-activated computers are a means of communication
								that can prevent a sense of isolation."
							</blockquote>
							<cite>- Christopher Reeve</cite>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							For those who may not know, Christopher Reeve is best known for his role as Superman. Later in life, he was thrown from his horse and became quadriplegic due to his spinal cord injuries.

							If for only selfish reasons you ensure your work is accessible, remember, like Mr. Reeve, we are all an accident or a few years of age away from needing assistive technology.

							Accessible development isn't about just following checklists and technical specs. It's just a change in mindset when creating digital experiences.

							For the change in perspective, there are 3 main things one needs to be effective at a11y development. I call them the "3 Pillars of A11y Programming".

							...

							The goal of my talk is to provide more awareness and to give context to potential problems, but empathy must come from within.
